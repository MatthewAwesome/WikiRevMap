## Project Overview

The goal of WikiRevMap is provided an interactive context in which the evolutions Wikipedia articles can be viewed over space and time.

When revisisions (revs) are submitted by unregistered contributors, the IP addresses used to submit such revisions are catalogued. Accordingly, since each IP address is (in most instances) attributable to a specific location, it is feasible to dynamically map a sizable proportion of Wikipedia contributions. 

## Let's Collaborate! 

To optimize education, we need to better understand how knowledge evolves. This app is (hopefully) a step in that direction. However, this is a journey! In addition to steps, we'll need paradigm-shifting leaps, which rarely happen in a vacuum! We're in the together! Thus, should you happen to think YourIdea + MyIdea == UnboundedAwesomeoness, we should get in touch! 

Drop me a line and/or fork the repo! 

One good idea at a time, let's make the world a better place!
