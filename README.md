## Project Overview

The goal of WikiRevMap is to provide an interactive context to explore the evolution of Wikipedia articles over space and time.

When revisisions (revs) are submitted by unregistered contributors, the IP addresses used to submit such revisions are catalogued. Accordingly, since each IP address is associated with a specific location, it is feasible to dynamically map Wikipedia revisions submitted by unregistered contributors. 

For details as to how this app is constructed, check out this article I wrote about it!

At present the WikiRevMap allows users to generate multi-frame revision maps for all articles belonging to the English language  edition of Wikikpedia. Moreover, in the present version of WikiRevMap, uses must interact with articles one-by-one. However, there are instances in which it may be advantageous simultaneous explore multiple article. 

To that end, this is just the beginning, and change is always a brewin'!

## Let's Collaborate! 

To optimize education, we need to better understand how knowledge evolves. This app is (hopefully) a step in that direction. However, this is a journey! In addition to steps, we'll need paradigm-shifting leaps, which rarely happen in a vacuum! We're in the together! Thus, should you happen to think YourIdea + MyIdea == UnboundedAwesomeoness, we should get in touch! 

Drop me a line and/or fork this repo.  

One good idea at a time, let's make the world a better place!
